# Source Code Plagiarism Dataset

The dataset can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of source code plagiarism detection. It consists of 467 Java source code files, covering seven introductory programming assessment tasks. Unique to this dataset, both intention to plagiarise and advanced plagiarism attacks are considered in its construction. The detail of the dataset can be seen in [the corresponding paper](https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/16/info) published in Informatics in Education.

# How to use
Each task contains three directories. 'Original' contains the original code for the task. 'non-plagiarized' contains N sub-directories in which each of them represents one code file, created independently from the original one. 'plagiarized' contains six sub-directories representing plagiarism levels from Faidhi and Robinson (1987). For each of those, it has N deeper sub-directories containing code files created by plagiarising the original one.
